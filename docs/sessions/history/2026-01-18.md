## Summary
Set up separate dev/prod Firebase projects and Square integration foundation.

## Work Completed

### Square Integration Foundation
- Simplified secrets to per-project pattern (PR #71)
- Set up separate dev/prod Firebase projects
- Added hostname-based environment detection
- Square integration foundation complete (PR #70)
- Added responsive navigation menu (PR #67)

### Infrastructure
- `maple-and-spruce` (prod) and `maple-and-spruce-dev` (dev) Firebase projects
- Per-project secrets with same names (no `_PROD` suffix)
- Hostname-based environment detection for web app

## Decisions Made
- **Decision 16**: Separate dev/prod Firebase projects - Each project has its own secrets with the same names
- **Decision 17**: Hostname-based environment detection - `business-dev.*` automatically uses dev Firebase project
- **Decision 18**: Per-project Square webhooks - Each project registers its own webhook URL with Square
